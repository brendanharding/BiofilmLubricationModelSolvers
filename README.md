# Biofilm Lubrication Model Solvers

The classes provided herein have been developed to produce accurate numerical approximations of the model described in the paper

 *A Thin-Film Lubrication Model for Biofilm Expansion Under Strong Adhesion*,\
A. Tam, B. Harding, J.E.F. Green, S. Balasuriya, and B.J. Binder,\
To be submitted soon, 2020. 

The folder BiofilmOneDModel provides a python class which solves the one-dimensional model described in the paper. The folder BiofilmTwoDModel provides a python class which solves the one-dimensional model described in the paper. Additionally, both folders contain an additional python script containing functions to aid plotting solutions and also a jupyter notebook that acts as a tutorial for using the solver class.
