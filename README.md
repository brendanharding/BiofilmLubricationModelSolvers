The folder BiofilmOneDModel provides a python class which solves the one-dimensional model described in the paper. The folder BiofilmTwoDModel provides a python class which solves the one-dimensional model described in the paper. Additionally, both folders contain an additional python script containing functions to aid plotting solutions and also a jupyter notebook that acts as a tutorial for using the solver class.
